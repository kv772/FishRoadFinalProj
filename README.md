Python game that is similar to the game, Crossy Road, but instead the user controls a fish as it attempts to make its way back into the sea
Functionalities
- ability to restart the game
- ability to score points
- dodging moving obstacles

Followed a tutorial to build some of the game, added original functionality by adjusting movment to be more quicker, added own avatars/obstacles, and changed the code for the avatars/obstacles respectively. Created own restart and start screen as well as the code that integrates the functionality.
